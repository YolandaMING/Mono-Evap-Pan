# Mono Basin Evaporation Pan 

Installation and data generation done by University of Michigan in association with Mono Lake Committee 

---

## Project Goals
* Obtain the in-situ evaporation rate
* Relate the evaporation rate with topographic conditions, such as air temp and RH
* Convert the evaporation rate to overlake surface evaporation
* Compare the result to ls2 model
